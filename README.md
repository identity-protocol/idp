# ðŸ§¬ Identity Protocol (IDP)

**I own my identity. No one else defines or controls me â€” not Google, not a government, not an algorithm.**

This is the official repository for the Identity Protocol (IDP), a quantum-resistant, logic-based system where every human can define, control, prove, and evolve their identity without relying on any central authority.

This is not another DID scheme. This is a full-stack, product-oriented ecosystem built on the following principles:

1.  **Absolute Sovereignty:** Your identity is yours. It lives on your devices, controlled by your keys.
2.  **Permanent Security:** Built in Rust with a hybrid, quantum-resistant cryptographic core to withstand the threats of today and tomorrow.
3.  **Human-Centric Trust:** Combining cryptographic proof with a human Web of Trust and a dynamic reputation system.
4.  **Product-First, Protocol-Second:** We solve real, painful problems firstâ€”like trust in online commerceâ€”to build a protocol with undeniable utility.

## The Vision

The internet has no "self" layer. We are building it. IDP will become the foundation of all future human-machine interaction.

## Project Status: Phase 1 (The Forge)

We are in the earliest stages of building the core protocol and CLI tools. We are looking for contributors who share our vision and demand technical excellence.

## Structure

This is a Rust Workspace containing the core components of the IDP ecosystem:

*   `/crates/idp-core`: The core logic library.
*   `/crates/idp-cli`: The command-line interface.
*   `/spec`: The formal specification for the `.idp` file format.
